# Javascript-Async-Await
Originally, JavaScript used callback

 to handle asynchronous actions. The problem with

callbacks
 is that they encourage complexly nested code which quickly becomes difficult to read, debug, and scale. With ES6, JavaScript integrated native promises which allow us to write significantly more readable code. JavaScript is continually improving, and ES8 provides a new syntax for handling our asynchronous action, async...await. The async...await syntax allows us to write asynchronous code that reads similarly to traditional synchronous, imperative programs.

The async...await syntax is syntactic sugar— it doesn’t introduce new functionality into the language, but rather introduces a new syntax for using promises and generators. Both of these were already built in to the language. Despite this, async...await powerfully improves the readability and scalability of our code.
